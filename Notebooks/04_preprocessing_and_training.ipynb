    "In preceding notebooks, performed preliminary assessments of data quality and refined the question to be answered. You found a small number of data values that gave clear choices about whether to replace values or drop a whole row. You determined that predicting the adult weekend ticket price was your primary aim. You threw away records with missing price data, but not before making the most of the other available data to look for any patterns between the states. You didn't see any and decided to treat all states equally; the state label didn't seem to be particularly useful.\n",

    "In this notebook you'll start to build machine learning models. Before even starting with learning a machine learning model, however, start by considering how useful the mean value is as a predictor. This is more than just a pedagogical device. You never want to go to stakeholders with a machine learning model only to have the CEO point out that it performs worse than just guessing the average! Your first model is a baseline performance comparitor for any subsequent model. You then build up the process of efficiently and robustly creating and assessing models against it. The development we lay out may be little slower than in the real world, but this step of the capstone is definitely more than just instructional. It is good practice to build up an understanding that the machine learning pipelines you build work as expected. You can validate steps with your own functions for checking expected equivalence between, say, pandas and sklearn implementations."

    "So far, you've treated ski resort data as a single entity. In machine learning, when you train your model on all of your data, you end up with no data set aside to evaluate model performance. You could keep making more and more complex models that fit the data better and better and not realise you were overfitting to that one set of samples. By partitioning the data into training and testing splits, without letting a model (or missing-value imputation) learn anything about the test split, you have a somewhat independent assessment of how your model might perform in the future. An often overlooked subtlety here is that people all too frequently use the test set to assess model performance _and then compare multiple models to pick the best_. This means their overall model selection process is  fitting to one specific data set, now the test split. You could keep going, trying to get better and better performance on that one data set, but that's  where cross-validation becomes especially useful. While training models, a test split is very useful as a final check on expected future performance."

    "These results suggest that vertical drop is your biggest positive feature. This makes intuitive sense and is consistent with what you saw during the EDA work. Also, you see the area covered by snow making equipment is a strong positive as well. People like guaranteed skiing! The skiable terrain area is negatively associated with ticket price! This seems odd. People will pay less for larger resorts? There could be all manner of reasons for this. It could be  an effect whereby larger resorts can host more visitors at any one time and so can charge less per ticket. As has been mentioned previously, the data are missing information about visitor numbers. Bear in mind,  the coefficient for skiable terrain is negative _for this model_. For example, if you kept the total number of chairs and fastQuads constant, but increased the skiable terrain extent, you might imagine the resort is worse off because the chairlift capacity is stretched thinner."

    "**Q: 1** Write a summary of the work in this notebook. Capture the fact that you gained a baseline idea of performance by simply taking the average price and how well that did. Then highlight that you built a linear model and the features that found. Comment on the estimate of its performance from cross-validation and whether its performance on the test split was consistent with this estimate. Also highlight that a random forest regressor was tried, what preprocessing steps were found to be best, and again what its estimated performance via cross-validation was and whether its performance on the test set was consistent with that. State which model you have decided to use going forwards and why. This summary should provide a quick overview for someone wanting to know quickly why the given model was chosen for the next part of the business problem to help guide important business decisions."

    "This notebook contains a ton of new information to me as a student.  Initially, we start with a bunch of imports to make sure we can utilize all of the tools we need.  We first start off with considering how accurate and useful the mean value is as a predictor.  We do this because we don’t want a model that is less accurate than just taking the mean value of our data.  In this notebook, we validate steps with functions and attempt to understand the ML process a bit more.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We load in our ski_data once more and extract `Big Mountain Resort` from it to use later.  After that we find our shape has decreased by 1 row, which is what we expected.  We look at what partition sizes we would have with a 70/30 split and get 192.5 and 82.5 rows.  We then get our training data to 192 rows, 35 columns, and the test data to 83 rows, 35 columns.  After this, we save the `Name`, `state`, and `Region` columns from our train/test data, into names_train and names_test.  Those columns get dropped from `X_train` and `X_test`.  So our shape that we call again on `X_train` and `X_test` are now 192, 32 and 83, 32 (dropping 3 columns).  After this we check the data types to make sure we only have numeric values in X_train and X_test.\n",
    "\n",
    "To actually test the mean, we just calculate the mean of y_train.  Our `train_mean` is 65.46 (which is what we got from the last exercise).  We then fit the dummy regressor from sklearn on the training data.  This gives us the same answer as the mean, great! - 65.46 for the AdultWeekend price.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Moving forward we calculate the R-squared, or coefficient of determination of the input.  To get R2 or R squared, we the the sum of the residual sum of squares and the total sum of the squares error.  If we take the residual sum divided by the squares total, and subtract that from 1, we will get our R2.  After this we can make predictions by creating an array with a length of 5, or the size of the training set with the single value of the mean.  5x 65.46.  We can also call in the `sklearn` dummy regressor to do the same thing. 5x 65.46.  This is a better use of space and code than using the R2 process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculating the Mean absolute error is the next step, and this tells us that on average we might expect to be off by around 18-19$ if we guessed ticket price based on an average of known values.  We can also look at the Mean squared error, the average of the square of the errors.  Taking the square root will bring us an equivalent compared to the mean absolute error.  We also figure out that if we switch the arguments for the R2 score, we will get different results - something to be aware of going forward.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now we look to impute the missing values from our data set.  We will use the median values of the data we have to fill in the missing data.  We use `fillna()` to pass the values into our data set.  Then we scale the data.  This is important because it sets all the data on an equal weighting.  We do the same process as before, but this time when we take the mean absolute error we get a much better estimate on the error.  7-10 $ vs 18-19$.  Same thing for the mean squared.  Instead of the median value, we try for the mean value.  Following the same process we end up with a similar result, so it doesn’t seem to make much difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we look at pipelines.  This will do the same steps as above just a different execution.  The pipeline produces the exact same results with a more concise code, this is fantastic.  Our second attempt on the pipeline produces a worse result, so we opt to change out k value.  Starting at k-15 we get a slightly better score, but this could go on for a long time.  We implement cross-validation, partitioning the training set into k folds, train our model on k-1 of those folds, and calculate the performance on the fold not used in training.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the `get_params` method, we get a view of all the parameters that pipe can use.  We get a range of k to investigate, and using sklearn’s gridsearchCV, we can track the best value of k.  The we use the lr_grid_cv to print the best_params_ from our grid.  I get 27 because of the additional rows I removed in the previous exercise.  We assign it to best_k and get the pipeline mean CV score graph.  Using the coefs_ attribute, we can get coefficients for each column, I have `fastQuads`, `vertical_drop` and `resorts_per_100ksq_mile` as my top 3.  Another option is the random forest model.  We will try it with both the mean and median as strategies for imputing missing values.  This improves slightly over the default CV results.  Lets plot it using a barplot.  The top 4 are in a different order, but are the same - runs, fastQuads, vertical_drop, and snow making_ac.  Comparing the random forest to linear regression gives us a slightly better random forest model.  We save the model as version 1.0 in our folder."
